This repository contains demos of Elix mixins applied to Polymer elements.

# Install

Since this repo currently uses a branch of the main elix/elix repo, you need to
install things with npm instead of Yarn.

1. `npm install`
2. `bower install`
3. `npm run build`

You should then be able to open the demo HTML files.
